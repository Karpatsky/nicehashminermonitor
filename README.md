This PHP scripts uses NiceHashMiner public API.
It supports NiceHashMiner's all supported algoritmas.
Basically, It pulls your miner's current situation and
it generates RSS Feed. You can use this RSS feed for sending yourself a notification
or email. I use ifttt.com and Telegram service for getting notification.
Both are free. I hope you will like this script.

Usage:
Just change Settings and upload this script to your hosting.
This script generates RSS feed for your NiceHash Miner. 
You can integrate with ifttt.com (free service). 
In my case ifttt.com checks this RSS feed, if miner is working,
it sends me Telegram messages like:
